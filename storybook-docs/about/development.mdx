# Development

Contributions are welcome for improvements and new components! Please raise a pull request that does one of these:

-   Modifies an existing package `/packages` to make improvements.
-   Adds a new package to the `/packages` directory. You must include `index.ts`, `package.json`, `LICENSE.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
    -   The documentation file is used to build a readme and Storybook page.
    -   The other files are used to publish the package to the JSR registry.
-   Adds a [Storybook Composition](https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/storybook-composition) entry for your own documentation.

There are $count packages in this collection. Some are web components intended for the DOM, others are utilities that components consume. **Each is published as it's own package with a readme, license, and documentation.** They are distributed through [jsr.io/@web-components](https://jsr.io/@web-components). The 'autoloader' can be used to load other components from [esm.sh](https://esm.sh).

## Producing documentation

Readmes, JSR config, and package documentation are updated by the files in the `/scripts` folder by GitHub Actions. These handle patch version bumping and config for automatic JSR registry publishing. They also handle compiling readme files from `package.json` files and `DOCUMENTATION.md` files.

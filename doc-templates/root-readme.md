-   There are $count packages in this collection. Some are web components intended for the DOM, others are utilities that components consume.
-   **Each is published as it's own package with a readme, license, and documentation.**
-   They are distributed through [jsr.io/@web-components](https://jsr.io/@web-components).

### Publishing documentation

Readmes, JSR config, and package documentation are updated using GitHub Actions to run the files in the `/scripts` folder. These handle patch version bumping and config for automatic JSR registry publishing. They also handle compiling complete readme files that combine `package.json` and `DOCUMENTATION.md` files.

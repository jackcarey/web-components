## Producing documentation

Readmes, JSR config, and package documentation are updated by the files in the `/scripts` folder by GitHub Actions. These handle patch version bumping and config for automatic JSR registry publishing. They also handle compiling readme files from `package.json` files and `DOCUMENTATION.md` files.

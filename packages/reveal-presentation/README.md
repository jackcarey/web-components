Instantiates reveal.js in a component so you can set up the light DOM children as slides. This component is packaged with reveal.js and it's default plugins. Highlight, Markdown, and Notes are enabled by default. The `embedded` flag is set to `true` by default.

No CSS or styling is included by default. Check out [reveal.js themes](https://revealjs.com/themes/) for that.

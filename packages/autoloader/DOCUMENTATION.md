The 'autoloader' has no options.
Component script tags are added to the head of the document using the [esm.sh CDN](https://esm.sh/). 
This is done when the components are first seen in the DOM and when the DOM is updated.
Utilities are not loaded with the autoloader, only DOM components.
DOM components are are versioned to match each autoloader release.
